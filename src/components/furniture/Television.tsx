// A flat panel resting on a TV console (not wall-mounted): thin matte bezel,
// an inset glossy screen with a soft diagonal reflection highlight, and a
// small foot bar along the bottom edge instead of a wall-mount bracket — the
// previous version was two near-black boxes (#0d0d0d / #161616) barely
// offset from each other, which at a glance just read as one plain black box.
//
// FurnitureMesh always centers an item's group at floor + dimensions.height/2
// (there's no separate "mounting height" field), so a TV item's own height
// doubles as its full floor-to-top footprint. To actually read as sitting
// *on top of* a low TV stand next to it, rather than a panel sitting on the
// floor behind the stand, the panel itself only fills the upper portion of
// that footprint — its bottom edge lands exactly at the reserved clearance
// height, which is where the foot bar sits. The clearance is pinned to a
// real stand height (0.36m — the sample TV stand is 0.28m tall, plus a
// visible gap) rather than a fraction of the TV's own height: a fraction
// landed barely above the stand with almost no gap, which didn't read as
// "resting on top of it." Clamped so a much shorter TV item still keeps a
// usable screen instead of the clearance eating most of its height.
